Within the models for users - include the following.  Reference Players model from endemic project

//At the top include this in order to hash the password
// Requiring bcrypt for password hashing. Using the bcryptjs version as the regular bcrypt module sometimes causes errors on Windows machines
var bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");

//After our schema include these functions
  Players.prototype.validPassword = function(password){
    return bcrypt.compareSync(password, this.password);
  };

  Players.addHook("beforeCreate", function(user){
    user.password = bcrypt.hashSync(user.password, bcrypt.genSaltSync(10), null);
  });
  return Players;


  **The landing.js and account.js could have probably been combined rather than having them split

  **In htmlRoute.js - we use the middleware isAuthenticated to ensure our user is already signed in and accessing routes that they are supposed to

  **server.js - we just import and include 3 lines to initialize and utilize passport and express-session
